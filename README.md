## 📘 About This Repository

Welcome to my Kubernetes Homelab repo! This is where I document everything I'm learning and building as I level up in DevOps — one deployment at a time. Whether it's following **Misha's excellent Kubernetes course**, experimenting with **self-hosted services**, or just breaking things and putting them back together — it all lives here.

Think of this as my DevOps playground — full of manifests, Helm charts, notes, diagrams, and war stories from the YAML trenches.

## 🧱 What You'll Find Here

- 🔧 **Helm Charts** — Custom Helm deployments and tinkering with templates.
- 🐳 **Containerization** — Building and deploying Docker images.
- 🔐 **Security Best Practices** — Securing clusters, namespaces, RBAC, and more.
- ☁️ **Self-Hosting Projects** — Deploying apps like Nginx Proxy Manager, GitLab, and more.
- 🧪 **Lab Experiments** — Networking, storage, GitOps, CI/CD... chaos included.

## ✍️ How I'm Using This Repo

This repo is **my second brain** for all things Kubernetes and DevOps:

- ✅ Document what I learn in real time.
- ✅ Share configs and experiments.
- ✅ Track progress on homelab projects.
- ✅ Learn by doing (and breaking).
- ✅ Showcase skills for future roles.

Everything I push here is a part of my **"learn in public"** journey. If you're also navigating the DevOps seas, feel free to fork, star, or reach out!
