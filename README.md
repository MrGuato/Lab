## 📘 About This Repository

Welcome to my Kubernetes Homelab repo! This is where I document everything I'm learning and building as I grow in DevOps — one deployment at a time. From testing self-hosted services to refining YAML files and learning real-world troubleshooting, this is my hands-on journey with Kubernetes.

Think of this as my digital lab notebook — filled with manifests, Helm charts, config notes, and lessons learned from breaking things (intentionally or otherwise).

## 🧱 What You'll Find Here

- ✅ **Kubernetes Fundamentals** — Pods, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc.
- 🔧 **Helm Charts** — Custom Helm deployments and template experiments.
- 🐳 **Containerization** — Building and deploying Docker images.
- 🔐 **Security Practices** — Securing clusters, RBAC, namespace controls, etc.
- ☁️ **Self-Hosting Projects** — Deploying apps like Mealie, Nginx, and GitLab.
- 🧪 **Lab Experiments** — Networking, volumes, GitOps, CI/CD workflows, and more.

## ✍️ How I'm Using This Repo

This repo acts as my second brain for Kubernetes and DevOps:

- ✅ Documenting what I learn in real time
- ✅ Sharing working configurations and experiments
- ✅ Tracking homelab projects and infrastructure setups
- ✅ Learning by doing (and breaking, then fixing)
- ✅ Demonstrating hands-on skills for future roles

Every commit reflects something I’ve learned, tested, or struggled with. If you’re on a similar path, feel free to fork, star, or connect!
