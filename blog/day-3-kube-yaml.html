## Day 3: YAML, Vim, and Saying Goodbye to Nano

Today was all about YAML, the language Kubernetes uses to define everything. (Used a lot in Docker, so a familiar space for me!) Writing YAML manually can be a pain, but Kubernetes has some tricks to make it easier. I also learned a few Vim hacks that made working with YAML files a lot smoother—looks like I’m officially making the switch from Nano.

## Editing YAML in the Cluster (But Should You?)
Kubernetes lets you edit resources directly in the cluster using:

kubectl edit pod <pod-name> 

This opens the Pod’s YAML file in Vim so I can make quick changes. It’s useful, but in the real world, editing live configs isn’t best practice. Everything should be version-controlled and applied properly. That said, knowing this is a must for the CKA exam, so I made sure to practice.

## Generating YAML with Dry Runs
Instead of writing a YAML file from scratch, Kubernetes can generate a template for me:

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx.yaml 

Now I have a nginx.yaml file ready to be modified before deployment. Much easier than starting from zero.

## Making Vim Play Nice with YAML
One of the most frustrating things about working with YAML is pasting text into Vim and having the indentation go crazy. I found a simple fix:

:set paste 

This prevents Vim from messing with formatting when pasting content. Definitely a lifesaver when copying YAML configs.

## YAML Example
Here’s the YAML file I generated and modified:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-yaml
  labels:
    run: nginx-yaml
    method: fromcode
    another: label
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx 

This defines a simple Pod running an Nginx container.

## Final Thoughts
YAML is everywhere in Kubernetes, so getting comfortable with it is a must. Between learning how to generate, edit, and cleanly paste YAML, today’s session felt like a big step forward. Also, after years of using Nano, it looks like Vim is officially my new editor.
