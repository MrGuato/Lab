## Day 4: Getting Inside Pods—Running, Debugging, and Troubleshooting

Today was all about getting inside Kubernetes Pods and working with them directly. Knowing how to interact with a running Pod, troubleshoot issues, and verify connectivity is a critical skill—especially when something inevitably goes wrong.

## Key Takeaways
Executing Commands Inside a Pod
Kubernetes allows you to jump into a running Pod and execute commands inside its container. This is useful for checking logs, debugging, or installing tools.

kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash

If the container doesn’t have Bash, I had to use sh instead:

kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- sh

Once inside, it’s basically like SSHing into a machine, except it’s a container.

## Installing and Updating Packages
Not all Pods come with the tools you need. If a troubleshooting Pod is missing curl, ping, or net-tools, I had to install them manually (assuming the container had package management).


apt update && apt install -y net-tools

This was especially useful when I needed to check network connectivity between Pods.

## Pinging Between Pods to Verify Connectivity
One of the most important things I learned today was how to test networking between Pods. Once inside a Pod, I could ping another Pod using its name or IP:

ping <other-pod-name>

If the Pod didn’t respond, it was either a network policy issue or DNS resolution wasn’t working properly.

## Realizing How Much Bash Matters
Since Pods are just Linux containers running inside Kubernetes, knowing Bash is a huge advantage. I’ve been working with Bash for years, so this part felt natural. But if I had to do all of this in PowerShell instead, I would have been struggling. Bash is second nature to me, so troubleshooting inside a Pod felt familiar.

## Final Thoughts
Today was an important step because being able to troubleshoot inside a Pod is a skill I’ll need constantly. Whether it's checking logs, verifying network issues, or installing missing tools, knowing how to execute commands inside a running Pod is a must-have skill for Kubernetes.

Next, I’ll be learning more about Kubernetes Deployments and how to manage Pods efficiently.
